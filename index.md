i'm courtney, and i'm a phd student :woman_student: at michigan technological university! i'm studying the movements and behaviors --- including foraging, predator avoidance, and habitat selection --- of moose on isle royale. i am interested in how the decisions of moose are impacted by ecological interactions and environmental conditions, and how they in-turn influence the forests in which they reside. 

along this journey, i am excited about developing and applying skills in environmental data science! i am particularly interested in image classification and utilizing/improving approaches to better understand the environment (snow, forest structure and composition, forest health, etc.) via remote sensing. i believe that data fusion and other opportunities to interface between fields -- such as wildlife biology :moose:, forestry :evergreen_tree:, and snow science :snowflake: -- benefits us all! i am also invested in the fair/care data management principles, and making science more open while also preserving indigenous data sovereignty and protecting sensitive information. 

my research is funded in-part by the datasense nsf-nrt program, which will support lots of collaboration and co-learning relevant to the above themes! in the meantime, i'm hoping to improve skills through online learning opportunities including those offered by the esiil lab at cu boulder.
